Emulation basics
================

.. slide:: Emulation basics
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Instructions are emulated (each time they are executed)

   * The other system components are also emulated:

     * MMU

     * Physical memory access

     * Peripherals

   * Target architecture - the architecture that it is emulated

   * Host architecture - the architecture that the emulator runs on

   * For emulation target and host architectures can be different

Classic virtualization
======================

.. slide:: Classic virtualization
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Trap & Emulate

   * Same architecture for host and target

   * Most of the target instructions are natively executed

   * Target OS runs in non-privilege mode on the host

   * Privileged instructions are trapped and emulated

   * Two machine states: host and guest


Software virtualization
=======================

.. slide:: Software virtualization
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Not all architecture can be virtualized; e.g. x86:

     * CS register encodes the CPL

     * Some instructions don't generate a trap (e.g. popf)

   * Solution: emulate instructions using binary translation


MMU virtualization
==================

.. slide:: MMU virtualization
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * "Fake" VM physical addresses are translated by the host to actual
     physical addresses

   * Guest virtual address -> Guest physical address -> Host Physical Address

   * The guest page tables are not directly used by the host hardware

   * VM page tables are verified then translated into a new set of page
     tables on the host (shadow page tables)

Lazy shadow sync
----------------

.. slide:: Lazy shadow sync
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Guest page tables changes are typically batched

   * To avoid repeated traps, checks and transformations map guest
     page table entries with write access

   * Update the shadow page table when

     * The TLB is flushed

     * In the host page fault handler

Paravirtualization
==================

.. slide:: Paravirtualization
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Change the guest OS so that it cooperates with the VMM

     * CPU paravirtualization

     * MMU paravirtualization

     * I/O paravirtualization

   * VMM exposes hypercalls for:

     * activate / deactivate the interrupts

     * changing page tables

     * accessing virtualized peripherals

   * VMM uses events to trigger interrupts in the VM


Intel VT-x
==========

.. slide:: Intel VT-x
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2


   * Hardware extension to transform x86 to the point it can be
     virtualized "classically"

   * New execution mode: non-root mode

   * Each non-root mode instance uses a Virtual Machine Control
     Structure (VMCS) to store its state

   * VMM runs in root mode

   * VM-entry and VM-exit are used to transition between the two modes


Virtual Machine Control Structure
---------------------------------

.. slide:: Virtual Machine Control Structure
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Guest information: state of the virtual CPU

   * Host information: state of the physical CPU

   * Saved information:

     * visible state: segment registers, CR3, IDTR, etc.

     * internal state

   * VMCS can not be accessed directly but certain information can be
     accessed with special instructions

VM entry & exit
---------------

.. slide:: VM entry & exit
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * VM entry - new instructions that switches the CPU in non-root
     mode and loads the VM state from a VMCS; host state is saved in
     VMCS

   * Allows injecting interrupts and exceptions in the guest

   * VM exit will be automatically triggered based on the VMCS
     configuration

   * When VM exit occurs host state is loaded from VMCS, guest state
     is saved in VMCS

VM execution control fields
---------------------------

.. slide:: VM execution control fields
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Selects conditions which triggers a VM exit; examples:

     * If an external interrupt is generated

     * If an external interrupt is generated and EFLAGS.IF is set

     * If CR0-CR4 registers are modified

   * Exception bitmap - selects which exceptions will generate a VM
     exit

   * IO bitmap - selects which I/O addresses (IN/OUT accesses)
     generates a VM exit

   * MSR bitmaps - selects which RDMSR or WRMSR instructions will
     generate a VM exit


Extend Page Tables
==================

.. slide:: Extend Page Tables
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Reduces the complexity of MMU virtualization and improves
     performance

   * Access to CR3, INVLPG and page faults do not require VM exit
     anymore

   * The EPT page table is controlled by the VMM

VPID
----

.. slide:: VPID
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * VM entry and VM exit forces a TLB flush - loses VMM / VM translations

   * To avoid this issue a VPID (Virtual Processor ID) tag is
     associated with each VM (VPID 0 is reserved for the VMM)

   * All TLB entries are tagged

   * At VM entry and exit just the entries associated with the tags
     are flushed

   * When searching the TLB just the current VPID is used


I/O virtualization
==================

   * Direct access to hardware from a VM - in a controlled fashion

     * Map the MMIO host directly to the guest

     * Forward interrupts

Instead of trapping MMIO as with emulated devices we can allow the
guest to access the MMIO directly by mapping through its page tables.

Interrupts from the device are handled by the host kernel and a signal
is send to the VMM which injects the interrupt to the guest just as
for the emulated devices.

   * Low bits of the address and the data indicate which interrupt
     vector to deliver to which CPU

   * Interrupt remapping table points to the virtual CPU (VMCS) that

   * Linux device driver for hardware virtualization (e.g. Intel VT-x, SVM)

   * IOCTL based interface for managing and running virtual CPUs

   * VMM components implemented inside the Linux kernel
     (e.g. interrupt controller, timers)

   * Shadow page tables or EPT if present

   * Uses qemu or virtio for I/O virtualization
